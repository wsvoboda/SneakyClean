## Locations

*Please note the maps on the "Locations" page will not load without a Google API key. Mine is omitted from the code on this repo for privacy reasons.* 

The locations tab pulls interactive maps using the Google Maps API. The maps are marked with the faux locations of Sneaky Clean. The locations are actually the locations of my bootcamp, DigitalCrafts!

Users are able to check if their zip code is within 50 miles of the physical store locations. The zip code check uses an API to check the distance between the Sneaky Clean location zip and the user's zip.

There is an if statement in the code deciding the output of the search. There are three possible outcomes of the search.
